# Transfer-Learning-Image-Processing
## Motivation
I always wanted to get my hands on transfer learning and see how state of the art, deep learning image classifiers can be transferred to similar, more specific tasks (here I used the food101 dataset).

This repo was created with the following questions in mind:

- How good can current state of the art (on the imagenet dataset) image classification architectures be used for specific classification tasks at hand using transfer learning? 
- Given a limited amount of images for a new classification task, what is the optimal approach for retraining the model? 
- How big does the dataset have to be, so that complete retraining of the model makes sense?
